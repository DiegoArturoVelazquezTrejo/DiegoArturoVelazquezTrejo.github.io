    		<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Diego Arturo Velazquez Trejo. I double majored in Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences. I am interested in applying Bayesian statistics, MCMC, genetic algorithms, and many other heuristics, computational simulation, stochastic and dynamic processes, machine learning, AI, numerical optimization, and tons of statistics to biological processes. Eager to participate in multidisciplinary teams to generate inclusive and effective solutions, as big data increases and there are biological problems that require innovative computational solutions, I have developed an interest in specializing in bioinformatics.</p>
    		<p>I'm particularly interested in studying bioinformatics to address contemporary problems in complex diseases such as cancer, HIV, and diabetes. My final goal is personalized medicine, where the insights and advancements in bioinformatics can contribute to tailoring medical treatments to individual patients. This passion drives me to explore the intricate interplay between computational methods and biological data, aiming to make a tangible impact on healthcare and patient outcomes. Specifically, I am drawn to pharmacogenomics as it presents a fascinating field where I can leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully.</p>

      <p>Developing countries (or economies in transition) face challenges in achieving more equitable, just, and community-appropriate social development. Health equity is a significant social challenge in these contexts. Mexico, classified as a middle-income country, shares with Latin America and the Caribbean a reality of social inequality and confronts a diversity of issues affecting the population at all development levels. The Mexican healthcare system continues to grapple with a dual burden of disease: malnutrition, infectious diseases (including epidemic outbreaks), and maternal-child health issues coexist with chronic-degenerative diseases and accidents…<br>

        <h2>Research Position for Social Service INMEGEN and Thesis Project</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am engaged in a research position at INMEGEN as part of my undergraduate social service, working under the mentorship of Dr. Pablo Oliva Sánchez (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo-Oliva-Sanchez-2" target="_blank">ResearchGate Profile</a>). This opportunity has led me to the Gemma 2d research group (<a href="https://gema2000d.org/" target="_blank">Gemma 2d Group</a>), where I am devoted to my thesis project: "Characterization of Chronic Control for HIV patients and its association with inflammatory biomarkers and cardiovascular risk."</p>

        <p>Within this endeavor, we are engrossed in a retrospective cohort study involving 200 Mexican HIV patients. Our project's overarching goal is to devise a robust statistical methodology that effectively classifies patients based on their chronic control of viral load and CD4 cell count, incorporating other pertinent variables from the cohort. Subsequently, we will explore the interplay between inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6, IL-16, PCR, VCAM, and D-Dimer within each classification group. Ultimately, our research aims to comprehensively assess the cardiovascular risk associated with differing levels of chronic control.</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>As a part of my social service commitment, I have taken on the role of an instructor for the "Fundamentals of Statistics" course. Commencing this August, I am guiding both graduate and undergraduate students from the Gemma 2d group (<a href="https://gema2000d.org/" target="_blank">Gemma 2d Group</a>) in this educational journey.</p>

        <p>In this course, I am enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge and expertise in statistics with the students. If you're interested, you can find more information about the course and its materials on the course's <a href="https://github.com/DiegoArturoVelazquezTrejo/Estadistica-1-INMEGEN-2023" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>
