    <h1>Diego Arturo Velazquez Trejo</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Diego Arturo Velazquez Trejo. I double majored in Applied Mathematics and Computer Sciences. I am interested in applying Bayesian statistics, MCMC, genetic algorithms, and many other heuristics, computational simulation, stochastic and dynamic processes, machine learning, AI, numerical optimization, and tons of statistics to biological processes. Eager to participate in multidisciplinary teams to generate inclusive and effective solutions, as big data increases and there are biological problems that require innovative computational solutions, I have developed an interest in specializing in bioinformatics.</p>
    
    <p>I'm particularly interested in studying bioinformatics to address contemporary problems in complex diseases such as cancer, HIV, and diabetes. My final goal is personalized medicine, where the insights and advancements in bioinformatics can contribute to tailoring medical treatments to individual patients. This passion drives me to explore the intricate interplay between computational methods and biological data, aiming to make a tangible impact on healthcare and patient outcomes. Specifically, I am drawn to pharmacogenomics as it presents a fascinating field where I can leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully.</p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>I majored in Applied Mathematics at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) where I had the opportunity to take some of the following courses:</p>
